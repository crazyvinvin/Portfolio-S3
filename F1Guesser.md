# F1 Guesser

## Project Description
For my individual project, I want to build a web application where you can guess Formula One race outcomes against your friends to compete for the most points at the end of the Formula One season.

## Full-Stack Web Application
The application should consist of a separate front-end and back-end. The back-end should be build using an Object Oriented framework whereas the front-end needs to use a JavaScript framework.

## Requirements
I’ve created a few simple requirements to give a better understanding about the project and the functionality that will be available.

**FR-01:** The user should be able to create a playgroup.
- B-01.1: A maximum of 8 people are allowed per playgroup.

**FR-02:** A user should be able to join a playgroup using a code from another user’s group.
- B-02.1: If the playgroup is full, the user that wants to join gets a pop-up that says that the playgroup is full.

**FR-03:** The user should be able to see how many points other people in his playgroup have.
- K-03.1: A user’s points is shown next to the user’s username.
- K-03.2: The user should be able to see a bar chart of all the points of the members of his playgroup.

**FR-04:** The user should be able to see a countdown to the next race week.
- K-04.1: A race week is from Monday till Sunday, if there’s a race on Sunday.
- B-04.2: The time to a next race week is only visible if a race week is not already happening

**FR-05:** The user should be able to go through a round of questions
- B-05.1: The user can only go through a round of questions during a race week.
- B-05.2: The user can only go through a round of questions when in a playgroup.
- K-05.1: During the round the user is able to select a F1 driver to answer each question.
- K-05.2: During the round the user gets to see how many points are available for each question.

**FR-06:** The user can see what answers other members of his playgroup have selected.
- B-06.1: The user can only see other member’s answers after having gone through the round of questions himself

**FR-07:** After a race week the user gets the available points for each question answered correctly.

## Conclusion
After a lot of doubt, I have chosen to change projects. Together with a few friends I have been playing on a Minecraft Server which has a mod (expansion) that adds programmable robots and computers to the game. I have a lot of motivation to build a project which uses data from those robots and computers. I think the F1 Guesser project is still an amazingly fun idea, it's just not the right project for me this semester.

Luckily, I will be able to use the knowledge I got in the last few weeks in my next project.
