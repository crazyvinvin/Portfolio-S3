# Agile? What?
During semester 3, one of my learning outcomes is that I learn more about "working Agile". Some of the important things about agile are: What is agile? What are the Agile principles? Which Agile methods are there? Are there any tools that could make working Agile more efficient? In this research article, I will be taking you through what I found about Agile and some of my thoughts on working with it.

### What is Agile?
Simply said, Agile is a set of rules called values and principles that help when making decisions, small and big. To work agile, you most likely shouldn't be following all of the principles Agile offers. A team should get a better understanding of the different principles out there and then choose the ones that are most important to them.

### What Agile principles are there?
I am not going to go into full detail on the Agile principles out there. However I will show some of the ones that caught my attention. If you want to checkout all 12 of the principles, you can do that [here](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/agile-principles/)

One of the principles says: "Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale." (3)
I think this one could be achieved in multiple ways. One implementation would be to work in sprints. Plan out a - for example - user story, finish the user story and get feedback on the way, all within a set few weeks. Having new working software every few weeks, is a skill that's hard to master. Sometimes it will happen that software isn't working at the end of a sprint. That's why it's important to review the working process regularly.

The principle that supports this says: "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly." (12)
