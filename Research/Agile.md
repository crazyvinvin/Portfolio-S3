# How can I improve the working efficiëncy of my team using an Agile methodology?
During semester 3, one of my learning outcomes is that I learn more about "working Agile". A few logical questions came up while gathering more information about the subject: What is agile? What are the Agile principles? Which Agile methodologies are there? Are there any tools that could make working Agile more efficient? Can I improve the working efficiëncy of my team using an Agile methodology? In this research article, I will be taking you through what I found about Agile and some of my thoughts on working with it.

### What is Agile?
Agile has something called the Agile Manifesto which holds a set of rules called values and principles that help when making decisions, small and big. To work agile, you most likely shouldn't be following all of the principles Agile offers. A team should get a better understanding of the different principles out there and then choose the ones that are most important to them.

### What Agile principles are there?
I am not going to go into full detail on all the Agile principles. However I will show some of the ones that caught my attention. If you want to check out all 12 of the principles, you can do that [here](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/agile-principles/)

One of the principles says: "Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale." (3). I think this one could be achieved in multiple ways. One implementation would be to work in sprints. Plan out a - for example - user story, finish the user story and get feedback on the way, all within a set few weeks. Having new working software every few weeks, is a skill that's hard to master. Sometimes it will happen that software isn't working at the end of a sprint. That's why it's important to review the working process regularly. 

The principle that supports this says: "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly." (12). A look back at every sprint is important to become more efficiënt and have a healthier workflow. You could ask yourself and your team the questions: "What went wrong and how can we improve?". Answering questions like this can be done by brainstorming, analysing why specific things went wrong and discovering what the cause behind it was. It's also very important to look at the things that went right and how you can make sure that they won't be lost.

A principle that really caught my eye was: "Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done." (5). Personally I love working on projects I'm really motivated for. It supplies me with energy and enables me to work from sunrise till sunset. Being able to take some decisions on your own or talking to friends about a project can be really motivating and I think this applies to many people.

### What Agile methodologies exist?
**Scrum**  
Scrum is an implementation of the Agile framework where a team works in sprints to achieve the product goal. Sprints exist of a short period of time in which only one or a few user stories are worked on. First it starts with planning the sprint by selecting and perfecting user stories or tickets for that sprint. After that the team starts working on the tickets that have been assigned and makes sure everything gets well tested. In the end the work is reviewed by the stakeholders, who can decide if they want to launch the product or make additional changes.  
Every day starts with a short meeting called "Daily Scrum" or "Stand Up". During these Stand ups the team discusses what they have worked on and what they will be working on. This makes sure that everyone knows how the progression of the sprint is going.  
There is also the Scrum Master, the Scrum Master leads the Stand ups and keeps the team stay focused on the important. They also keep the team on the scrum road, making sure they follow the agile principles they agreed upon.

**Kanban**  
The biggest difference between Kanban and Scrum is that the project does not get seperated into sprints. This makes it possible to focus on the duration of a task (for example a user story), instead of a set duration of for example 3 weeks for multiple tasks. Because of this, the product can be continuously delivered.
