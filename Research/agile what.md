# Agile? What?
During semester 3, one of my learning outcomes is that I learn more about "working Agile". A few logical questions came up while gathering more information about the subject: What is agile? What are the Agile principles? Which Agile methods are there? Are there any tools that could make working Agile more efficient? In this research article, I will be taking you through what I found about Agile and some of my thoughts on working with it.

### What is Agile?
Simply said, Agile is a set of rules called values and principles that help when making decisions, small and big. To work agile, you most likely shouldn't be following all of the principles Agile offers. A team should get a better understanding of the different principles out there and then choose the ones that are most important to them.

### What Agile principles are there?
I am not going to go into full detail on all the Agile principles out there. However I will show some of the ones that caught my attention. If you want to check out all 12 of the principles, you can do that [here](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/agile-principles/) 

One of the principles says: "Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale." (3). I think this one could be achieved in multiple ways. One implementation would be to work in sprints. Plan out a - for example - user story, finish the user story and get feedback on the way, all within a set few weeks. Having new working software every few weeks, is a skill that's hard to master. Sometimes it will happen that software isn't working at the end of a sprint. That's why it's important to review the working process regularly. 

The principle that supports this says: "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly." (12). A look back at every sprint is important to become more efficiÃ«nt and have a healthier workflow. You could ask yourself and your team the questions: "What went wrong and how can we improve?". Answering questions like this can be done by brainstorming, analysing why specific things went wrong and discovering what the cause behind it was. It's also very important to look at the things that went right and how you can make sure that they won't be lost.

A principle that really caught my eye was: "Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done." Personally I love working on projects I'm really motivated for. It supplies me with energy and makes me able to work from sunrise till sunset. Being able to take some decisions on your own or talking to friends about a project can be really motivating and I think this applies to many people.
